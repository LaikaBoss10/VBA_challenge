### VBA challenge assignment for Module 2 of UCB extension data analytics bootcamp.

### This repository includes a .bas VBA file that can analyze multiple sheets of stock data in the format of the file "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx".

### It results in the analysis shown in the included screen shot. It is useful to quickly determine the price change, percentage change and total stock volume of the various stock tickers included in the data.

### To use the .bas file on an excel sheet open the .xlsx file in excel, go to developer and open the Visual Basic tool. Then drag and drop the .bas module in the directory in that tool. Open the module and run. This will apply the desired changes to the excel file.
